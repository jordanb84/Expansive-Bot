# Expansive-Bot
ExpansiveBot is an open source Skype bot made in Java for the purpose of
both becoming very feature filled with contributions, and a learning resource
for other's bots. The code is very efficient and easy to expand upon, so learning from
or adding to it should be easy.

For an example and to use the bot without hosting yourself, please add
expansivebot on Skype.

Please read the documentation below if you are going to use any of the
bot's code or contribute, as well as the license described in LICENSE.

This bot is based on Java and the Skype Java API by Taksan, however the API it is based on
has a Python counterpart. If you would like to convert any of this
bot's code or examples to Python, it should be easy using the Skype4py API.
